I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Architecture at Central South University, China,with a primary research focus on historic buildings.
Throughout my studies, I have consistently achieved strong academic results and have been awarded several academic scholarships. 
I completed an MSc in Sustainable Building Studies at the University of Sheffield and hold a Bachelor’s degree in Engineering.
This interdisciplinary educational background spanning architecture, engineering, and sustainable building enables me to engage simultaneously with architectural space and historical context, building physics and environmental performance, as well as digital systems and data structures. 
It provides a well-aligned intellectual and methodological foundation for doctoral research centred on digital twins that integrate microclimate and energy considerations.
